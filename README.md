dotfiles
========

Set of my dotfiles

* `awesome` window manager configuration, modified version of default one
* `.tcshrc` originally from FreeBSD but suits Debian boxes well. Inspired by Valeriy Proshkin long long time ago
* `.vimrc` configuration based on several tips & tricks articles, includes wombat256 color scheme
* `.gtkrc` some strange line which forces GTK applications to use msttfcorefonts font
